    question: "How much does a custom wardrobe cost in Melbourne?",
    answer: "The cost varies quite a bit depending on the size, style (walk-in vs built-in), materials chosen, internal fittings, and complexity of the installation.

  },
  {
    question: "What's the process for getting a custom wardrobe designed and installed?",
    answer: "It starts with an initial chat and consultation where we understand your needs. Then we measure your space, create designs for your approval, help you select materials and finishes, and provide a quote. Once you give the go-ahead, our local team crafts the components and installs the wardrobe in your Melbourne home."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it typically take from design approval to installation?",
    answer: "The timeframe can vary based on material availability and our current schedule, but generally, you can expect installation within a few weeks of finalising the design and quote. We'll give you a more precise timeline when you order."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design wardrobes for small bedrooms or tricky spaces?",
    answer: "Absolutely! That's a key benefit of custom design. We specialise in creating smart storage solutions for all kinds of spaces, including small rooms, rooms with sloped ceilings, or awkward nooks. We design to maximise storage and functionality, no matter the challenge."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of materials and finishes do you offer?",

We also have a great range of options for internal shelving, drawers, and accessories, plus quality hardware like soft-close hinges and drawer runners."
  },
  {

export const showerScreenFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What are the main types of shower screens you offer?",
    answer: "We offer a range including frameless, semi-frameless, fully framed, fixed panel (for walk-in showers), sliding door screens, and over-bath screens, catering to various styles and bathroom layouts in Melbourne homes."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a new shower screen generally cost in Melbourne?",
    answer: "Costs vary significantly based on the type (frameless is typically the most premium, fully framed often the most budget-friendly), the size of the screen, the glass thickness, hardware choices, and installation complexity. We provide a free measure and quote service across Melbourne for an accurate price."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the pros and cons of frameless versus framed shower screens?",
    answer: "Frameless: Pros include a luxurious, spacious look and easier cleaning (fewer edges). Cons can be higher cost and potentially slightly less water containment compared to fully framed if not perfectly installed. Framed: Pros include excellent water sealing, durability, and usually a lower cost. Cons are the more visible framing which can trap moisture/dirt and may look less modern to some. Semi-frameless offers a compromise between the two."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to install a shower screen?",
    answer: "A standard shower screen installation typically takes our specialists a few hours. Depending on the type of sealant used, you may need to wait 24 hours before using the shower to allow it to cure properly."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the easiest way to keep my shower screen clean?",
    answer: "Regular cleaning is key! Using a squeegee after each shower significantly reduces water spots and soap scum build-up. For cleaning, use mild soap and water or a recommended non-abrasive glass cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals or scourers that could damage the glass or hardware."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the shower screen won't leak?",
    answer: "Leak prevention starts with precise measurement for a custom fit. Our professional installers use high-quality silicone sealants applied correctly at all necessary junctions between the screen, walls, and shower base or tiles. The design choice (e.g., framed vs frameless) can also influence water containment."
  },
  {
    question: "What thickness of safety glass do you use?",
    answer: "All our shower screens use toughened safety glass compliant with Australian Standard AS/NZS 2208. The thickness typically ranges from 6mm for fully framed screens up to 10mm (or sometimes 12mm) for frameless designs, ensuring strength and safety."
  },
  {
    question: "What warranty do you provide?",
    answer: "We offer a warranty covering the shower screen materials (glass, hardware) and the installation workmanship, giving you peace of mind. Specific warranty details are provided with your quote."

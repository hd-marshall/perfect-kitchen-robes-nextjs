  },
  {
    question: "What's the process for getting a custom wardrobe designed and installed?",
    answer: "It starts with an initial chat and consultation where we understand your needs. Then we measure your space, create designs for your approval, help you select materials and finishes, and provide a quote. Once you give the go-ahead, our local team crafts the components and installs the wardrobe in your Melbourne home."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it typically take from design approval to installation?",
    answer: "The timeframe can vary based on material availability and our current schedule, but generally, you can expect installation within a few weeks of finalising the design and quote. We'll give you a more precise timeline when you order."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design wardrobes for small bedrooms or tricky spaces?",
    answer: "Absolutely! That's a key benefit of custom design. We specialise in creating smart storage solutions for all kinds of spaces, including small rooms, rooms with sloped ceilings, or awkward nooks. We design to maximise storage and functionality, no matter the challenge."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of materials and finishes do you offer?",
    answer: "We offer a wide selection of high-quality materials, including durable laminates, polyurethanes (painted finishes), timber veneers, and mirrored or coloured glass doors.

  },
  {

export const showerScreenFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What are the main types of shower screens you offer?",
    answer: "We offer a range including frameless, semi-frameless, fully framed, fixed panel (for walk-in showers), sliding door screens, and over-bath screens, catering to various styles and bathroom layouts in Melbourne homes."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a new shower screen generally cost in Melbourne?",
    answer: "Costs vary significantly based on the type (frameless is typically the most premium, fully framed often the most budget-friendly), the size of the screen, the glass thickness, hardware choices, and installation complexity. We provide a free measure and quote service across Melbourne for an accurate price."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the pros and cons of frameless versus framed shower screens?",
    answer: "Frameless: Pros include a luxurious, spacious look and easier cleaning (fewer edges). Cons can be higher cost and potentially slightly less water containment compared to fully framed if not perfectly installed. Framed: Pros include excellent water sealing, durability, and usually a lower cost. Cons are the more visible framing which can trap moisture/dirt and may look less modern to some. Semi-frameless offers a compromise between the two."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to install a shower screen?",
    answer: "A standard shower screen installation typically takes our specialists a few hours. Depending on the type of sealant used, you may need to wait 24 hours before using the shower to allow it to cure properly."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the easiest way to keep my shower screen clean?",
    answer: "Regular cleaning is key! Using a squeegee after each shower significantly reduces water spots and soap scum build-up. For cleaning, use mild soap and water or a recommended non-abrasive glass cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals or scourers that could damage the glass or hardware."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the shower screen won't leak?",
    answer: "Leak prevention starts with precise measurement for a custom fit. Our professional installers use high-quality silicone sealants applied correctly at all necessary junctions between the screen, walls, and shower base or tiles. The design choice (e.g., framed vs frameless) can also influence water containment."
  },
  {
    question: "What thickness of safety glass do you use?",
    answer: "All our shower screens use toughened safety glass compliant with Australian Standard AS/NZS 2208. The thickness typically ranges from 6mm for fully framed screens up to 10mm (or sometimes 12mm) for frameless designs, ensuring strength and safety."
  },
  {
    question: "What warranty do you provide?",
    answer: "We offer a warranty covering the shower screen materials (glass, hardware) and the installation workmanship, giving you peace of mind. Specific warranty details are provided with your quote."

export const vanityFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What's the general cost for a custom bathroom vanity in Melbourne?",
    answer: "Custom vanity pricing depends heavily on the size, style (wall-hung vs floor-standing), chosen materials (especially benchtop and cabinet finish), number of drawers/doors, and complexity. We offer a free design consultation and quote service across Melbourne to provide an accurate cost based on your specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get a custom vanity made and installed?",
    answer: "Typically, from final design approval and payment of deposit, manufacturing takes a few weeks. Installation itself is usually completed within a day, depending on site readiness. We'll provide a clearer timeline specific to your order."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the most durable materials for bathroom vanities?",
    answer: "For benchtops, engineered stone and porcelain are very popular due to their high durability, water resistance, and ease of cleaning. High-pressure laminates offer a budget-friendly durable option. For cabinets, we use high moisture-resistant (HMR) particleboard or MDF, often finished with durable polyurethane (2-pack) paint or quality laminates specifically designed for wet areas."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the main advantage of a wall-hung vanity versus floor-standing?",
    answer: "Wall-hung (floating) vanities create a sense of spaciousness, make floor cleaning much easier, and offer a modern look. Floor-standing vanities typically provide more internal storage volume and can sometimes be simpler to install regarding plumbing configurations. The best choice depends on your storage needs, style preference, and bathroom layout."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you supply the basin and taps too?",
    answer: "Our main focus is designing and building the custom vanity cabinet and benchtop. We design it to perfectly accommodate your chosen basin and tapware. While we don't typically supply the basin and taps directly, we can certainly guide you on suitable styles and sizes, and coordinate the design around your selections."
  },
  {
    question: "Does your installation include connecting the plumbing?",
    answer: "Our standard installation service includes securely fitting the vanity cabinet and benchtop in place. The connection of taps, basin waste, and pipework needs to be completed by a licensed plumber, which is usually arranged separately by the client or builder as part of the overall bathroom renovation."
  },
  {
    question: "What warranty do you provide on your vanities?",
    answer: "We offer a comprehensive warranty covering the materials and workmanship of our custom-made vanities, ensuring they are built to last in Australian bathroom conditions. Specific details are provided with our quotes."

export const slidingDoorFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Where are custom sliding doors typically used in a home?",
    answer: "They're incredibly versatile! Common uses include wardrobe doors (especially built-in robes), room dividers (e.g., separating lounge/dining areas or creating a study nook), closing off pantries or laundries, and even as modern ensuite entrances within a master bedroom."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the approximate cost for custom sliding doors in Melbourne?",
    answer: "The cost depends on factors like the overall size (height and width), the type of track system, the door panel materials chosen (e.g., glass vs solid panels, frame type), and the number of doors. We provide a free measure and quote service across Melbourne to give you an accurate price based on your specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the main difference between top-hung and bottom-rolling tracks?",
    answer: "Top-hung systems suspend the door's weight from the track above, providing a clear threshold below â€“ often preferred for room dividers. Bottom-rolling systems support the weight on a track at the floor, which can sometimes be simpler to install depending on the ceiling structure. We can advise which system is best for your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get sliding doors for my wardrobe?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Sliding doors are an excellent choice for wardrobes (both built-in and walk-in styles) as they don't require swing space, allowing for more flexible furniture placement in the bedroom. We can match door finishes to other joinery."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the installation process usually take?",
    answer: "For straightforward installations, our team can often fit your new sliding doors within a day. More complex setups or multiple door installations might take slightly longer. We'll give you a clear time estimate when you order."
  },
  {
    question: "How effective are these doors at blocking noise?",
    answer: "While primarily designed for visual division and space-saving, well-fitted sliding doors with solid panels and quality seals (as mentioned in our features) do provide a noticeable reduction in noise transfer compared to an open space. However, they may not offer the same level of soundproofing as a standard hinged door within a solid wall."
  },
  {
    question: "What maintenance is required for sliding doors?",
    answer: "They are generally low maintenance. Regularly cleaning the tracks to keep them free of dust and debris will ensure smooth operation. The door panels can be cleaned according to their material (e.g., glass cleaner for glass/mirrors, a damp cloth for solid panels)."

  },
  {
    question: "What are the main steps involved in getting a new kitchen designed and installed?",

  {
    question: "How long does a typical kitchen renovation take from start to finish?",

  },
  {
    question: "What materials do you recommend for kitchen benchtops and cabinets?",
    answer: "We work with a range of high-quality options to suit different styles and budgets. Popular choices include durable engineered stone (like Caesarstone or Quantum Quartz), modern laminates, timber, and premium 2-pack polyurethane finishes for cabinetry. We help you choose the best materials for your needs during the design phase."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you supply kitchen appliances as well?",
    answer: "While our main focus is custom cabinetry, benchtops, and splashbacks, we design your kitchen to perfectly integrate your chosen appliances. We can work with appliances you source yourself or recommend suppliers based on our experience."
  },
  {
    question: "I need help deciding on a kitchen style. Can you assist with design ideas?",
    answer: "Absolutely! With over 25 years of experience, our design team is skilled at helping clients discover their style. We can show you examples, discuss current trends, and guide you towards a design â€“ whether it's modern, classic, Hamptons, or something uniquely you â€“ that suits your taste and your Melbourne home."

export const laundryFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What does a custom laundry renovation typically cost in Melbourne?",
    answer: "The cost varies significantly depending on the extent of the work. A simple cabinetry fit-out will differ from a full renovation involving plumbing and electrical work. Factors include the amount of cabinetry, benchtop materials, type of sink, and any custom features. We offer a free consultation and quote service across Melbourne for your specific laundry cabinetry needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's involved in getting a custom laundry fit-out from you?",
    answer: "Our process focuses on the cabinetry and benchtops. It involves an initial consultation to discuss your needs and measure your space (including appliances), designing a layout and storage solutions, helping you select materials, providing a detailed quote, manufacturing the components, and professionally installing the cabinetry."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical laundry fit-out take?",
    answer: "The installation of the cabinetry itself can often be done within a day or two. If it's part of a larger renovation involving other trades (plumbers, electricians, tilers), the overall project timeline will be longer. We'll provide an estimated timeframe for our part of the job."
  },
  {
    question: "What materials are best suited for laundry cabinets and benchtops?",
    answer: "Durability and moisture resistance are key. We recommend High Moisture-Resistant (HMR) board for cabinets. For finishes, quality laminates or polyurethane (2-pack) paint are excellent choices as they are hardwearing and easy to wipe down. Laminate benchtops are a very popular, practical, and cost-effective choice for laundries, though engineered stone can also be used for a premium finish."
  },
  {
    question: "How can you help make the most of a really small laundry space?",
    answer: "Custom design excels here! We use strategies like vertical storage (tall cabinets, overhead cupboards), stacking washers and dryers where possible, integrated solutions like pull-out ironing boards or hampers, and clever corner units to maximise every available centimetre."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to give you the measurements for my washing machine and dryer?",
    answer: "Yes, please! Accurate dimensions (height, width, and depth) for your specific appliances are essential for us to design cabinetry that fits perfectly around them, ensuring proper ventilation and access."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design 'European laundries' hidden inside cupboards?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We can design clever cabinetry solutions to conceal your laundry appliances and supplies within a cupboard system, often found in hallways, kitchens, or bathrooms, ensuring they blend seamlessly when not in use."
  },
  {
    question: "What warranty do you offer on your laundry fit-outs?",
    answer: "We provide a comprehensive warranty covering the materials and workmanship of our custom-built laundry cabinetry, ensuring quality and durability for this hardworking space. We provide specific details with our quotes."
